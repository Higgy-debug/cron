No, I was working before I was taking art and craft classes And I used to take it from my home only But now I have stopped it. And what's the reason? Why did you stop? Responsibilities are increasing day by day. How were you managing before? So before 5 years my in-laws were not like this. And they used to do their work on their own. So now there is no one to look after them. So it's my full time duty. But they have been living with you since before? Yes, we are together. And now the son is independent. Yes. There is no work for the son or any stress. No. It's just that I have to make food for them. Do you intend to get back to this art and craft? I definitely intend because it's my hobby also and it's my passion also so right now i don't charge anything but i definitely do it for the kids of my building only whenever they need some help they come to me and i do it for them but that taking classes and charging for it? Do you miss that? Definitely Like what things? I was getting me time. Right now that me time is not there. Like what do you mean? What were you getting? I enjoy I enjoy the work what I do That's it. Yeah. I enjoy the work what I do. So that is why I used to do it and I would definitely like to go back to it. Did that money that was coming in irrespective of the amount, was that also a me time aspect? No, no, no. So money was not the aspect but the fact that you are working. Yes, yes. The fact that I was doing what I was liking. And how many years did you do it and then you stopped? I did it for more than 10 plus years. Oh wow! And it's a skill, right? Yeah, it's a skill. Correct, correct. But you've always been staying here, Santa Cruz? Yes. Since my marriage I am here. And these guys were here, in fact, even when they were born, since then they are here. And before that, where did you stay? I used to stay at Ghatkopar. So how was life? Did anything change for you? Yes, it has changed a lot. So like Ghatkopar is like little middle class people. Here little posh crowd is there. And language, there I used to live in Gujarati community itself. Here it's a Cosmos society. So living in a Cosmos society you get a totally different experience. So how did you adjust? It took me a while, around 2-3 years. But finally I got adjusted. How many years now into marriage? 18 years. So if we look at your whole life, who has been the biggest influence in your life? Influence? My father you can say. Who influenced you the most in your life? Influence... My father you can say Yeah? Yeah And after marriage also, were there any other external... I mean outside the family also, any support system or any... There is... One of my friend is there She stays in the next lane itself I always take her advice if I want to do something, if I want to change something. I always take her advice. If I want to buy also, I take her opinion at least. So she is also similar age group? Yeah, same age and even she is a homemaker. How many rooms do you have in your house? It's a 3 BHK apartment. So one for your son, one for you and one for in-laws. And are there any full time maid arrangements? There are no full time maids but maids do come and go. One maid comes in the morning and she has given her mother for bathing. So she does her part and she leaves. So comes 8.30 to 9.30. Right now the one is there, she comes from 10 to 11. So she helps me in extra work like cutting, chopping, drying clothes, dusting etc. So she does all those things cooking is absolutely done by me okay and then so usually routine What is your routine? Give me a big understanding of what is different between weekday and weekend? Routine is very sorted. I get up by 7-7.30 and prepare meal and breakfast for the family. By 10, my husband leaves. By 11, my son leaves. And in that, there are maids also do the work. So, 11 to 12 I am a bit free. What do you do? Generally, nothing happens. I take care of my own bathing. And by the time it's 12, it's lunch time. Then I make chapatis and visit for lunch. Then I take a nap in the afternoon. I read newspaper. I take a nap in the afternoon. I have to call someone. I finish all that in the afternoon. 4 o'clock again it's tea time. After that I go to market after coming back I prepare dinner and at night I watch TV. Now we have stopped watching those serials and all it's all about Netflix and Amazon. Okay and how is the weekend different? In the weekends, What do you do differently? For now, nothing is different. We have been doing this routine for the last 4 years. Because we can't leave them alone. So, you have to go somewhere. Yes, we have to go somewhere. Going with friends?

Santa Cruz West Outside the station Outside the station, you have all branded showrooms In fact, on the linking road also you have all branded showrooms. In fact on the linking road also you have all branded showrooms. So at times I go, I take a rick and go to linking road and there I go shopping. So usually my market place is also in Santa Cruz West. Though I reside at Santa Cruz East, I go to Santa Cruz West. So it's a daily routine that I go to different places and I am a shopaholic you can say that I am a frequent shopper. And how frequently do you shop? I buy something once or twice a week. Once or twice a week? Once or twice a week. Alone or with someone? Alone. No friends? My friend who lives next door is with me.

Online is just for surfing. But you surf? Yes, I do. And what do you surf for? Now, as I wanted to buy a dishwasher, so I first saw brands. I shortlisted in brands. Then I saw the size. Because I had to accommodate in my place. So I saw the size and then I saw the features. But you were made, right? Yes, but if I don't come then it is very painful. Like in Ganpati, no one comes for 10 days. Oh, yeah. So everything goes on. It helps a lot. It helps a lot. Correct.

It has to be there. Can't survive without it. And when I say the word value, what comes to mind? You should value money It's not like If you have money, then spend it and go We spend it only by thinking Unnecessary, unwanted things buying not all that I don't do it When you go to buy something buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, buying things, It is okay if the brand is good or not. Does the brand matter? Generally, no. If I like it, I don't care if it is branded or not. No matter how much or how less it is. Even if it is an upper limit. I don't spend extravagant. But if it is a good amount then it is okay. And if you like it but there are some quality issues then? I won't take it. But quality will not be compromised. No, quality will not be compromised. Irrespective of whether you like it visually but quality should be good. There should be comfort. So comfort is important, quality is important. Price, upper limit, value for money and then you should like it. Same thing if you want to buy something for family, this is the criteria. Do you think younger generation women, their thinking is different from the mindset of family? Do they have different mindset about their family or their mindset? They might not look out for comfort. Give me an example. I have stopped wearing heels on routine days because my leg pains. So, I wear flats or platforms wherever I go, I wear flats or platforms. They would not prefer. They will wear heels. Also, would their choice of products for their household and versus your choice of products for their household. Today's generation is more into brands. Brand focused. Yes. Today's generation is more into brands Brand focused Yes Whether it gives result or doesn't they would definitely focus on brands And the process of buying? Where do you gather the information? Everything is online You don't have to go out Is that the only reason? No, that's not the reason They feel comfortable During weekdays they keep working. Like Monday to Saturday or Friday they keep working. So they get one day. So they want to spend that day for themselves. They don't want to spend that day in buying process. It's better to sit for ordered online after sitting for half an hour. At any point of time, outside our building, 2-3 Swiggy Zomato's are sitting. So many deliveries come. If you catch the delivery in the morning, it starts at 7 am and ends at 1-2 pm. So they are more into such things. Yes. Also, if we talk about brands, like the kind of brands that you would choose versus the kind of brands that they go after, is that any different? Maybe, as I told you that I don't spend extra on vegan. They would not mind spending. Okay, okay. Or any brands that you would not prefer, for whatever reasons, you have stopped or you don't want to use it but they will do it. Do any brands like this come in our food? Any category? Like Jimmy Choo's purses etc. I find them very expensive. I feel that if they don't keep so much money in such expensive purse then what is the meaning? But... Okay, okay. What about food or any other category? In food also, it happens that in 5 stars, like my friend was saying. They said they could get a dal makhani for 2500-3000 rupees. I said I would not come also and I would not prefer to spend this much on this. But as far as the brands that come in the house, the things of the house, do you think the choices of the newer generation of younger generation and someone like you? People are more into organic products and brands. What is your opinion on that? We eat good food. People have started eating Bajra and Ragi. We have already started eating it. We have never stopped eating it. When a new thing comes in the market, do you think your approach versus their approach will be different? In order to get excited and bring home. Younger generation gets excited fast they would try fast they would switch fast are there any categories in which you would be interested but they would be more interested in these categories younger generation would be more interested in food we don't switch fast we eat what we have been eating for years. Besides food? Besides food, if it is something like personal care. In personal care, in fact I also try. And they also try. In cosmetics, in personal care, I also bring different brands. Like earlier I used to use Dant Kanti's toothpaste now I have switched on Anchor So how do you get to know about these things? We go to departmental stores Ok, so you get to know from there And I know you take all the decisions but for example you just bought a dishwasher or when you have big purchases like this tell me, from initiation to execution, is the process complete or does the husband come there? Everything is mine. He only pays. But do you discuss whether we should buy or not? Yes. Whether he likes it or not, I discuss it with him. But he doesn't have any objections? No. That he doesn't want to buy it now, he wants to wait for 2 months. Generally, he knows that he will buy it only if it is necessary. Like let's say tomorrow if you decide to buy one big appliance, hypothetically. Yes. You decided, you want it. Yes. Like how would you approach him and what would you go and tell him? I want to buy this. And what will 99.99% of them say? They will search for the brand they want. So they will only come together. But will he give his inputs that I will also search for him. No, no. In any category? In any category. They don't even look at your clothes. And the groceries that come at home or staples or snacks, how many times do you get them from D-Mart online versus when you go offline, from where and how many times? I order it once a month. Cheese, butter, oil etc. are served with it. I bring the less quantity from the local market. I order it once a month. From where? From local market? Yes, we have a departmental store at the station. Do you get any other things from there that you don't get from D-Mart? Dal, different pulses etc. So, that doesn't come from D-Mart? No, I don't like the quality. So, which brands are these that come from departmental stores? They are not branded. They are local. Like the stores like Gujarati store. So, all the eatable pulses, staples like rice, wheat etc. are available from there. Some of them are branded like Toor Dal, which is made of grapes. Basmati is made of daawat. And like you said, Maag, M math, chana dal, all that is local. Got it. And once it is completed from D-Mart, then what is left, Any inputs from anybody in the house that bring this, bring that? Yes, like I brought in between, I brought the thing of Govardhan, then my son did not like it and said to bring only the original one. Okay. Is. Anything else? Snacks etc. If anything changes in taste. Do you ever ask your son to order something from D-Mart? Do you have cold drinks? He does that. Okay, he does that. He does that. You give the list. Yes. I tell him that this is for me and this is for him. So, along with that, he has a lot of things. What are those things? In which category? They are bakery products that you buy? What are the products that you buy? They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. They are bakery products. So, I am very mindful that it should come in this way only. And what are the things where money is also not important? Meaning irrespective of the price, you don't spend on it. I don't see money in food and drink. Okay. And what are the things in the budget? I don't see money in cosmetics. Do you see money in cosmetics or not? I don't see money in cosmetics. Okay. I use only what I use. So, what are the do you do within budget? Within budget, I can say some things like in personal care, if I bring bathroom cleaner, toilet cleaner, I bring all that within budget. I bring bleach in my budget too. Okay, so let's talk about the cleaning products. I don't get the ala in the bleach. The ala and the normal bleach liquid is the same. Okay, let's talk about the cleaning products. Tell me which things are used for cleaning at home. First of all, which things are used? Vimbar and scrubber. Vimbar for utensils and scrubber and then? Surfaxel powder Then what else? Then what else? GoGo's floor cleaner Which one? GoGo? Where can I get this? Again a departmental store In your departmental store And? GoGo's toilet cleaner Ok And? Double B soap For clothes And? What is the quantity? How much do you order a time? In a month it takes get 4 in one delivery. I usually get 5-6. 4 in 5? Do you get it all at once? Yes, all at once. From where? D-Mart or departmental? You must get this in D-Mart too. I have to pick up the delivery from D-Mart. Oh, delivery is there. No, ready delivery is not available. But normal D-Mart takes 50 or 49 rupees extra for delivery I am saved like this and then the delivery charge is there So that matters right? Yes, obviously But you will also go and spend in auto? No, it is on our corner only Okay, then it makes sense Husband or son can take it on bike So when you order from demart then you're mindful of the fact ki aap kya mangare ho aur kitna mangare ho obviously to multiple times mangak sakte ho na vise toh like rather than ordering once in order for you to be able to pick it up yourself at a time your order should exceed of thousand. So, it gets finished. And it gets finished in one go. Yes. But the soap doesn't come in the container. Do you get cleaning products from there? Nothing comes from there. Okay. The departmental stores here come. And what is the reason? I get it written and come and deliver it. What is the reason for not buying cleaning products from there, from D-Mart? The reason is that I get the same price at both the places. I have to either go to D-Mart to buy or pay the delivery charge. This person leaves me at home. But there is a little less pricing in D-Mart, right? This also gives the same discount. It gives? Ok. And how much does Surf Excel cost you? I actually bring all that in quantity. Like 4 kg, 6 kg, 4-5 kg. How many days does it take you? It takes 3-4 months. It takes 3 months. What are the things you use Surf Excel for? Surf Excel is for clothes and for washing the bathroom. Do you keep it separately or in one place? In one place. When it is so big, do you empty it in a container? Yes, we empty it. Then do you make separate containers according to the month or in one container? No, we keep it in one container. It is kept in one place. And what is the quantity of the floor and toilet cleaner? One is enough. Is there any scheme for it? It is 1 plus 1. So, both of them are 1 plus 1 and 1 plus 1. No, they are the same. Single and single. They can also do that. And how many days does it take you? Earlier, it was my mother-in-law's, so she used to bring all that things and stock them but I don't stock them. What's your idea behind that? If you get it from the market then why should you buy it from home. But are there some things that you stock? Pulses. In pulses only Dal and Rice. For how long? Till 6 months. But you do Surf excel? Not much, 4 kgs. But still you take 3 kgs. I used to bring toothpaste 12 times. Why to bring toothpaste 12 times? Yes, this is Gujarati culture. Yes, this is Gujarati culture.

I am just generalizing They are very good I have heard that the liquid products are good Why don't you use it? You mean the Surf Excel and all of that Yes, Aerial, Mantic, Liquid and all that I want to try but I am not lying What is stopping you? Nothing as such, I can try it Okay, but the ones that you are using, which are the best in cleaning? GoGo's toilet cleaner is amazing Do you know any other products from this brand? I have seen only these two Floor cleaner, toilet cleaner No other products like utensils, soap etc. No other products like utensils, soap etc. No other products like utensils, soap etc. Are there any other brands that you associate with cleaning? Are there any other brands that you associate with cleaning? If you say cleaning then these brands Is there any other brands? Harpic. Ok. Any other? Domex. Ok. And what is the reason? Mr. Muscle. What is the reason Mr. Muscle, Domex or Harpic? There are many ads. But have you tried? I haven't And what's the reason? I know you have seen a lot of ads But you've not felt like trying See the basic purpose is cleaning Cleaning the toilet or the bathroom and that I am satisfied with my product And their prices I think 1.5 times more And where have you seen these ads? On TV And do you get to know about them anywhere else? Any other place like whenever you go out, departmental stores Yes, departmental stores etc Do you look out for such things also? When you go out, do you look at those new products? In which category are they? What products are you seeing on the shelf? Do you keep an eye on them? In which category are you seeing the products on the shelf? Do you have such a view? Not in all these categories. In general? Yes, in general. Not in this category? Not in this category. Not in the category of toilet cleaning. So, in which category definitely? In food, in cosmetics. Is there any product in cleaning? No. There is no product in any section of cleaning. So, basically stick a product which is available in any product? No. It is not available in any section of cleaning. So, basically stick to whatever you buy. I have brought this liquid from Pitambari. I have brought this liquid from Pitambari. I have brought this liquid from Pitambari. Yes, liquid. How did you get to know about it? It was also on display. But that is also for cleaning. How did you focus on that? I felt something different. I had a problem with Pitambari that it is more rough in the hand. Correct. So how do you come to know? Means, a new product has come in the market or there is a new product. How do you get information about it? There are ads. Is there anybody else also that tells you, speaks to you about this? In the friend circle, there is no talk of cleaning. And mostly all these cleaning products come with the other items only? The ones that come with the staples or this comes separately? It comes with it. So do you write the list or you go and choose? No, I go, fill up the basket, give my address and then he says. So, does he send it immediately or after what time? Whenever you ask. And if there are no new brands, for example, whatever you are going in the aisle for cleaning products, if there is a new brand or a new variant, how will you know? We keep it on display. But you said you don't look out. That's what I am asking. By default, he goes there. If you pass through there, he goes there. What is it that you see? When do you get interested? When do you get interested? Packaging. Attractive colors. What kind of colors are there? What influences them? A little brighter color. Okay. And? What kind of colours are there that make them visible? What influences them? A little brighter colour. Okay. And? Like the material of Ariel is white in colour. And the colour of Tide is a very bright orange. So, if you don't want to see the Tide and if you want to ignore it, then also you can't do it. You will lose your attention. Hmm. So, is it, why is Surf Excel influenced? Because you talked about Jhatak Orange. So, do you feel like changing Surf Excel and bringing Tide? No. Because, in the mind, Tide is a mediocre product. It can harm the clothes. Sometimes it happens that when you see the packaging, because you spoke of packaging, then in any cleaning product, if the packaging is good or there is an element on the packaging, then I feel like bringing it. It could be anything, color, design, anything that is mentioned. Has it ever happened that you go and you check out? What is it? Pick it up and see. Have you ever got a patient who you go and check out? I told you that I have used this instead of Pitambari powder. I understood that it is a liquid because of Pitambari powder. Like everybody has an issue with that. Anything else that you liked? One thing is that it is not in the powder format. And what did you like about it? Like where did you get the confidence that you can definitely try? I saw the reel of it on social media. I was watching some of the powders and I also saw the reel of Vim. Do you think that is the video of the Did you start this recently? No, last year. How much influence is there that this is a product of Vimka? Let's say if it was not from Vimka then it would be from someone else. Yes, if it was from any other brand then I would not have bought it so quickly. But since they are into cleaning products, they can trust it. And the packaging, did that also make a difference? Packaging is not that attractive. It's just white with a golden cover. Yes. Okay, got it. Is there any other new cleaning product that you have tried recently? Any variant or brand, any format, anything that you have tried recently. So, the cleaning procedure that you have done, if you have to tell me in order of importance, this is the most important cleaning, if you tell me from the most important is a toilet clean oh you mean the bowling yes only the ball thing yes okay and second would be second would be the bathroom of the floor cleaner okay take care that's detergent for me take care That's detergent for me. Okay. And third would be to clean the floor. To clean the floor. Okay. Which is called phenyl. Correct. Third would be that. And what about utensils and clothes? Where do they go in order of importance? After floor cleaning, clothes and then utensils. If I talk about bathroom cleaning only, if I have to make a list of the things that people use for bathroom cleaning, if I have to keep it on a line like this, I have made a line because at both the ends we want to keep diverse products. We use it for bathroom and they are absolutely different than each other. We use bleach powder at one corner and at the other farthest end we use bleach powder at one place. And the second last, the most contrast but it is used for bathroom. one is the most used for bathroom cleaning. How is the contrast? I mean bleach powder is one contrast which is used.

No, in the sink, I just start the tap and use my hands. It gets cleaned. And the toilet cleaner is done by flushing it. So do you also clean the seats and around? Yes, I clean them with a jet. Do you use the same brush? Yes. So, scrubber for sink, brush for your toilet commode and the outside area. And for the bottom, you use a broom and detergent. What's the quantity of everything that you use? How much liquid do you use for the toilet cleaner? Approximately. Like this. In this manner? Yes. And the detergent for the floor? We don't dilute it. We just add a little water. Yes, just a little water. It's easy for scrubbing. But every time these three things are used, because I remember you saying that if I do it today, I mean if you do it 4 times or 3 times. Are there any signs that tell you that you have to do it today? No, it's my routine only. It's just that if I don't have time, I skip any of it. What is the factor of not having time? What happens when you tell yourself that you don't have time and having time to do it? Sometimes I have to go somewhere or someone is coming and I am not ready for something. Then I get lost in that work. Not ready means food? Yes, I am not ready for food. Then I get lost in that work. Rest it is a daily routine.

When does that happen? It happens very fast. Like I said, we wash the sink and the commode. We just put water in the bathroom. Does it happen when you don't clean or when you don't have time? But the bathroom... Sink and commode are there. Why don't you leave that? Why does it happen when you don't have time? It's because of the fear of bacteria. Okay. That's the mindset. Are there any visible signs which tell you that yes I have to do it? There can be visible signs. There are? If it has been used multiple times then there can be visible signs. Ok. There are many people who also wipe the bathroom. Yes. I don't. Do you also do it? I don't. I just keep it open for a while and it gets ready. Do you use that?

No then you don't need it and when you wash it what is the feeling? how do you? You feel satisfied that you are using a place which is hygienic and clean. And what about when you feel the same feeling, but tell me, the two days which you couldn't do it.

Okay. She puts bleach in diwali The liquid of bleach that I bring for clothes She puts ala in diwali What is the process of that? She puts ala with detergent What happens to that? They say that it is more clean and white than putting bleach They put ala in this room in diwali Because white flooring is nice This is only one time I told you. I know I understand. This is only one time I told you. I know I understand. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. This is only one time I told you. They mix the ala with detergent. But you don't dilute it, right? No. Then how do you mix it with detergent? This is only one time I told you. I know, I understand. That in Diwali itself. So, they mix it with detergent, that means they dilute it at that time. Yes, they take detergent in a mug and put ala in it. And mix it and spread it like this at home. And then they scrub it with a broom. Okay. And they do the same thing for the bathroom. Yes. You never do it? No. I never touch the bathroom. Have you seen any difference after that? That cleaning, the bathroom cleaning? Yes, there is a brightness. Not here, what difference does it make in the bathroom? It comes there also. And they use it for the commode and the sink also? Yes. And for the tiles also? Yes. So if there is a brightness, then always? But they don't touch the bleach everyday. Yes. So they don't touch the bleach everyday. Yes. So they don't touch the bleach everyday. Yes. So they donode and the sink also? Yes. And for the tiles also? Yes. So if there is brightness then always? But they don't touch the bleach everyday. But it is necessary to touch it, it will be done without touching it. No, no. It is applied on the hand. If you scrub, then it is applied on the hand also. Have you ever used it? Let's say you don't have it and you wanted to use it. What is that? What other cleaning products are there in the Diwali? You said that Alaa is used. What else is there in the bathroom cleaning? What else is there in the bathroom cleaning? You said that you have to do all the cleaning And some other things are different That's it Do they do it? They wash the buckets and all They wash the buckets once or twice a month It's not like they wash it in this Okay, tell me Kajal, you are saying that she does it, she does it but if she doesn't do it, you are fine with it? No, I don't use ala. No, no, my question is that do you want her to use ala at that time? Yes, because it gives result. What is that one thing that you would want that I know the harmfulness of ala, that's why you don't use it. Let's say that it is not getting harmed. So, the result thing, keep that result in mind and tell me. What would you like from your detergent or whatever you use for cleaning? That thing you want, should also come in it. Without taking much efforts, shine should come. So, this shine comes in your detergent yes shine comes in detergent but efforts are required like what is that effort? it has to be rubbed so you rub it on your face also yes and by applying bleach, I can only rub it on my face by applying bleach it leaves the stain. So, you don't have to put so much effort. You don't have to rub so much. So, tell me in time duration, with detergent, how many minutes do you have to rub the same effect or how long does it take to clean? If you have to rub it for 5 minutes, then it takes 2 minutes. So, it is a matter of reducing effort. Both the results are giving the same. No, it is better than ala. I understand that the effort has reduced. So, it is about reducing effort. Both the results are the same. No, it is better than Alla. I understand that the effort is less. Effort is less and the result is better. What is the result that is better? Shine. So, shine does not come in detergent. Cleanliness comes but shine does not come. So, A. Effort should be less and shine should be there. Shine is something that you are missing. I can give you an example of this. If we wash the white shirt with double B, then it will be clean. But that brightness and whiteness will not come which will come from the bleach. Got it. Understood. So, it is the same. Understood. Do you face any frustrations or challenges with detergent for bathroom cleaning? No. It's just that you have to scrub a little more. So you have to scrub a little more. That's the challenge. Any other challenge? I am thinking that this can also happen because this is a common complaint in the matter of clothes for people who use detergent powder that the particles remain in the clothes. So, usually there is an issue in the bathroom that water is being used more or I have to clean a little more, it becomes slippery. One thing is that water is a little detergent because if I want a lot, if I want clean, then I put detergent accordingly. If there is more detergent, then I add more water. And then, fear of falling? Fear of falling? They remove it from water. But, does it not happen while scrubbing? No. But you have to be very sure that it will be removed completely. Your legs should be firm. No, no, I am saying even after you put all water and all, still, Yes, it doesn't stay. But does it stay? A little residue? Not really. Sometimes in corners? Sometimes it stays a little bit in corners. What do you do then? It comes out the next day. So, don't bother much about it. But, does he have to take care in their bathroom? Yes. In their bathroom, the maid puts so much water that there is no question of staying. Okay. They use water without any hesitation. Our life is a little burnt, so they use less water. Okay. You have mentioned the bathroom cleaner of Heart Pick. You thought that maybe the doctor comes for muscle, but then you missed a muscle. But then you are not sure whether it comes or not.

But then you are not sure whether it comes or not. It comes with the Dermix. Floor cleaner. Sorry, bathroom cleaner comes. Floor cleaner. No, no. Bathroom cleaner. Can a floor cleaner be used for bathroom? It can be used for bathroom floor only. No. Why? Its purpose is different. Its purpose is different. I like that expression, why it is not working. Because we have to rub there. It is not like we have to wipe it. But if it can work here, then why not there? Here it is smooth tile. So we have to wipe it. And there scrubbing is also necessary. Tell me, why it is not working? Since this is a smooth tile, it needs to be cleaned and scrubbed.

I haven't used the brands but the brands are very popular. They are there in the market since years and people are using them. Do you think Harpic bathroom cleaner will have any benefit?

The wind will be a little thick. The heat will be more. The heat will be more. Again, the wind will also be thick. The wind will be a little thick. The heat will be more. The heat will be more strong. Again, the wind will be strong. If it is like a wind, then it will be like a toilet cleaner. It should have a thinner consistency. It should spread. It should spread automatically. If I put it, it should not go back and forth. Some people say that detergent works better than a cleaner like Harpic for the bathroom. Do you agree or disagree? I agree. For the stains especially? For the stains. Harpic uses one detergent for bathroom cleaning. What are your 5 arguments for your product? What will the detergent one say? Why is her product better than Harpic bathroom cleaner? The detergent gives scrubbing so it cleans better. The smell of detergent also comes. It also gives a good smell. Harpic scrub is not required. It is an advantage. I think it has bleach in it. It also gives shine. This is also an advantage. What is the disadvantage in comparison to detergent? Harpic has bleach. I have a doubt. Detergent does not have bleach. I have a doubt that there is bleach in Harpic. There is no bleach in detergent. So what is the detergent? There is a scrubbing effect in Harpic. There is no scrubbing effect in Harpic. What is the scrubbing effect? The more you rub it, the more it will leave the dirt. I am thinking, I am not necessarily right. But if you scrub it more with Harpic, then you can do that scrub there also. What is the problem? thinking I'm not necessarily right but harping del que abjada scrub caro get off of these cover hopper with our September yeah because we're looking a movie so yeah before us I've cost rubbing carney he put a game as a valley feeling here but also fighter can look son can't which name so that's an advantage for Harpic. For Harpic. So the only advantage that I have picked up of detergent over Harpic. In this, bleach. That's it. No more. No more. Is there any other aspect like price wise or anything? No. The one who is concerned about cleanliness will not see the price. If you want to make an ideal bathroom cleaner for yourself, according to your own brain and usability, according to your needs, what will happen in that? I will make a liquid without bleach, which spreads well and leaves stains as soon as it spreads spreads which scrubbing is not required ok a product which does not have bleach but you apply it and leave the stains plus it should have liquid consistency right flowy consistency it should be in color and fragrant like a jasmine yes and should it have any other features other features to make the cleaning better? It should be like reaching to the corners Like How to put the knob of the toilet cleaner inside It should be like that Okay and if you add any magic or quality to it, what should you do? It should be a long lasting fragrance. How long? What is the specialty of a good bathroom cleaner? How long will it last? It should last for at least 2-3 hours. You can tell me the best time. What is the speciality of this product? How long will it last? It should last for at least 2-3 hours. You can tell me the best that you want. Yes, it should last for at least 2-3 hours. How long does the detergent last? 1-1.5 hours. So, 2-3 hours is sufficient or you would want it to last a little longer? I would definitely want it more but I am telling you this reasonably. And if we talk about wish, how long would you ideally want it to last? Till the next use. And when if you're for example using the cleaner, what is the frequency that you would want to use it? Meaning, how much of its effect should be lasting? One day day One day means you will have to do it the next day Yes till the next day But it is not like that you have done it today and you don't want to do it tomorrow No, no If someone comes and says that you need to clean your face for a week How will you react to that? You will have doubt This bathroom is a thing which is used daily I will react to it. Doubt will come. This bathroom is a thing which is used daily. Tell me one thing, when mother-in-law was in charge, what did she use for the bathroom? Detergent. That too detergent. Has she ever used bleach? She used to bring bleach first. For the bathroom? Yes, but I didn't say that I will the bathroom. But I didn't use it. Have you seen any effects? Like any pain in your hand? Yes, I have. What happened? My skin is soft and sensitive. They are not getting any. They say that it happens. It happens to ladies. That's okay. She was fine with it. But you were. Ladies have it. That's okay. She was fine with it. But you were not fine with it. So tell me, you know a lot about Harpit. But till now, Harpit bathroom cleaner is special. Why didn't you try it? I am satisfied with what I am using. And how many products I am using. Different for this, different for that. Okay. Multiple products All in one product Which can be used everywhere Like As I told you about my friend She uses detergent everywhere In commode, sink She uses detergent everywhere On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being highest How much you feel like To try Harpeet once We can try On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being highest, how much do you feel like trying Harpic once? We can try it once, 4 times. What will happen is definitely like the next month's purchase you would go and bring a Harpic to the bathroom. Use sample product then sure And apart from that, if you don't have sample, you go and you buy it What will be that motivation or trigger? Maybe that knob I told you that the packaging is a bit like that It is going in the knob Like a toilet cleaner? Like a toilet cleaner Or it is shown in its that it leaves the dirt easily. Okay, any brand ambassador? I remember you spoke to me about ads. Have you seen any ads? I have seen but I am not able to remember. Absolutely fine. But any other person in ads, like you told about cleaning. If there is a brand ambassador, definitely you would want to try. Because brand ambassador only do publicity and reuse. So what else to tell in such ad? So you felt that I will go and come right now. There are some busy ladies who don't have time and they just put the liquid in the toilet and leave. They do their other work and when they come back they leave the stain and they just put a little water in it. Have you seen Harpic bathroom cleaner in the supermarket that you go? I think I have seen it. The one in red is for bathroom cleaner and the blue one is for toilet Do you know how much ML it comes for? Generally it comes for 750 ML Approximate pricing? What do you think would be the pricing? Approximate? According to you? May be 120-130 ML What do you feel of the pricing? If it is 120 for 750 ML, what do you feel of the pricing? If it is 120 for 750 ml What do you feel of the pricing? It's reasonable What pricing if it was more efficient Would you try it? If it was less Can try How much would it be? definitely I would buy it once. Maybe 80-90. How long do you think this 750 ml bottle will last? If it is that much then it will last for a month. If it is less then maybe more than a month. Then it will be a value for money. If Harpreet was a human being, tell me, imagine what kind of a human being he would be, how he would look, what he would do, what kind of thoughts he would have. A modern guy with broad thinking. thinking whether my dressing is high-fi or I speak less but I work and show Similarly if there are two women, one is a detergent user and the other is a Harpic bathroom cleaner user, tell me what are the similarities and differences between both of them? Similarity is both related to their home, both of them focus on their household chores, difference difference reason can be a co aware me hey yeah so switch come on any chatty yeah the pricing point bad okay towards the end I want to ask if you are the marketing head of Harpic, bathroom cleaner, what will you do that people will definitely go in for a Harpic bathroom cleaner? What will you add to your product or what strategy will you do that people will switch from a detergent to Harpic bathroom cleaner? I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. I will change my marketing strategy. We have reached our toilet cleaner customers. And the second strategy is that we can give a pouch with a bag. We can give a 10-10 rupees pouch. And one ad I said that a lady with a busy schedule, she leaves her work and comes back to work and only has to put water in it. What will you tell them? In that ad, why Harbik bathroom cleaner is better than detergent? No efforts required. No efforts. And reaches all the corners without any efforts. I will tell you three more sentences which you can use in the pitch. I want you to just rank which one is best. One is unbeatable cleaning supremacy, ultimate torture test on stains, long lasting cleaning. This is one. You can have a look at this. Actually, we are talking about this. So basically, there can be some benefits. So, already you know some benefits of the Heart-Bed Bathroom Cleaner. What is the additional benefit that you think can help in the marketing strategy Is the convenience of cleaning better? Less effort or less time? Or is there a better value proposition in this? More cleaning in less effort. But if you have to choose that foil or detergent, then focus on cleaning more. For example, it removes stains of 10 years or even 50 stains of bathroom. Or convenience is more important. It will reduce the effort or it will take less time and effort to clean the bathroom. Bathroom stains are not 10 years old or 50 years old. This is not your kitchen. There will be 50 types of stains. These clothes are not even 50 types of stains. Either it will be water stains or Sushu potty stains. So for that you don't need to mention the number of stains. You will just need less effort and it will be convenient. And what are the cons of this product? that you don't have to do any effort or time is more important that you have to soak this detergent for 5 minutes and in 1 minute it will be instant cleaning action yes, the first one effort one no need to do any effort got it You don't have to clean it. Got it. So, if you try a bathroom cleaner, what will you try for it? Where will you use it? You said you will use floor, sink, commode, these three things. So, where will you use the bathroom cleaner and how will you use it? What do you think? I will use the bathroom cleaner in the bathroom. Yes, so, in which surfaces? If you I use bathroom cleaner in bathroom also. Yes, so in which surface if you bring bathroom cleaner? I can use in sink also and on bathroom floor, I don't use in commode. So you use in sink and floor both. And how do you feel, how will you use it? With dispenser As a straightway And then? Will you keep it for some time or will you rub it? So that I will have to check what is the procedure Procedure, okay And like detergent and Toilet cleaner or ala How did you know about them? How to use it? Since years we use it at home So we get to know So you saw your mother I have been using it for years now. I have been using it for years now. I have been using it for years now. You saw your mother. Yes. You were saying that you had told me many things that if you talk to people outside, it will take less effort. If you are full, you can talk to them. It will take less time. You also said that you don't take multiple products. You also said that you will not buy multiple products But you will get some shine or effort from it What can happen that you will not try it Then there are too many products And if you will bring it now then you will use both detergent and bathroom If I bring it then I will use it only both the detergent and the bathroom cleaner? If I bring it, then I will use it only. Then why use detergent? And as you said that you have a maid. So, will you give her a bathroom cleaner or will she use her own phenyl? Or will you use dynamics? Then I will have to see the pricing point because their hand is very open. So, I have to check how much I bring. Otherwise, I will put it and give. Right, now you rub. And you said that there are two bathrooms. One which you are washing and one which she is washing. How are they different? I don't use that bathroom. And my time to wash is to wash is before taking bath. I wash my bathroom only when I want to take bath. You said that you wash your bathroom once a week. What are the extra things that you wash? I wash the tiles from the top. Tiles and Null. Tile and Null. And while you were saying that you didn't see how it works, but what product do you use? Same. Detergent. Both tile and this one. But she must be diluting, right? Because if she wants to use it on tile, means on wall tiles, then... Yes, she dilute it again. And does she use the same scrub as your sink? Yes, she uses the same for the sink. So, they are kept separately for the scrub. Yes, they are kept next to the sink. Okay. And you were telling that the floor of the hall, you have to wipe it, not rub it. Bathroom means you have to rub it. Bathroom floor has to be rubbed. Why do you have to rub the bathroom floor? The water gets stuck in the corners of the bathroom floor. Because the water goes in the corners of the bathroom floor. So, it has to be rubbed and removed. Again, the floor surface is little rough. This is smooth and when you say that sometimes you use freshener when the bathroom is not clean so when you use freshner When it is used multiple times. That is more on usage or when the bathroom is not clean? More on usage and at times when the commode is not washed. But it doesn't happen generally. Okay, got it. Why are you using gogo on the sink and detergent on the floor? Because my sink is also white. So what is the difference between the two? Because it is white, I applied it on my face. I applied the same thing on the toilet cleaner. You must have been told to clean the bathroom, not the whole bathroom, but a small portion of the bathroom. A small portion of the bathroom, a small patch of your sink He had told me but I refused him that I have it after taking a bath Actually, I will show you the sink if you want Is it okay? Yes, the sink and the floor A small patch of the floor, not the entire area We can see the other bathroom, right? Yes, we can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process. We can observe both the bathrooms and the cleaning process.\n"
